# Thermal-Sniffer
Sensor to detect micro temp variation for thermal flying (typical 0,03 °C)
this device beeps if you comes nearby a thermal column (rise in temperature). 
Previous devices in the 80's didn't compensate for temperature variations with pressure.
Sniffer was beeping in heavy sink (not intended if searching for a thermal because you would be looking for the heaviest sink)
They didn't store you unlike traditional altivarios a reference (like 0 m/s) and gave you just a sound in function of the temp
variation 
(a bit like if your altivario gave you audio-output only if rise in thermal was increasing or decreasing not if it was stable)
therefore you need a reference temperature  (like 18,7 °C was the last recorded temp before temperature increase or decrease) 
The device will beep in function of this reference.
